            <p>The virgin of the passion icon, also known as Our lady of perpetual help, dates back to 1499 where it is documented to have been recieved at the church of saint matthew in Rome. It was recorded to have been located on the Island of crete before that, where the Virgin Mary worked many miracles through it. A Cretan merchant stole the icon and fled to Rome. Soon he became deathly ill, and on his deathbed besought a Roman to give the icon to some place of worship where it could be venerated. But the Roman's wife convinced him to let her leave it in her bedroom. Several times the Virgin Mary appeared to the Roman to restore the icon to a more honorable place, but he ignored her. Finally she appeared to his six-year-old daughter, saying "Our Lady of Perpetual Help commands you to take her out of your house" â€“ so our Lady herself gave the name by which we now know this icon. After two visitations like this, the mother gave this miraculous image to the Augustinian Fathers at the Church of Saint Matthew.

                For the next three centuries the Church of Saint Matthew held its place as one of the most frequented pilgrimage sites in Rome, because Our Lady's icon was enshrined there. Pilgrims from all over the world, from lowly peasants to esteemed cardinals, flocked to see the miraculous icon and seek the Virgin's help and blessing. </p>
