            <p>The Icon is located in Sinai, Egypt at the Monastery of Saint Catherine. The monastery was built between 548 and 565, and is the world's oldest continuously inhabited Christian monastery. The monastery is built around what is believed to be the burning bush seen by moses.It also encloses the Well of Moses where he met his wife. The well is still functional and is used to draw water for the monastery. This holy place also has been referred to as the oldest known libray, housing works such as Codex Sinaiticus and the Syriac Sinaiticus.</p>
