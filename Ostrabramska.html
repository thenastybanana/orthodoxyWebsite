        <p>Icon corner is a website created by a lone pilgrim. As the best way to learn is to teach, so my catechumenite has been filled with webpages created for my own edification. <br> <br> I love orthodoxy. Unfortunately my mind is quite scattered. Typically I am doing two things at once. In creating this website, I am learning about Orthodoxy and I am learning how to write code. I see the screen filled with Icons and I want to kiss it. My screen is touch screen so I presume that would create some adverse effects. <br><br> As I learn more about the churches timeless beauty, please send me an anonymous message! I'd love to hear from you.</p>
