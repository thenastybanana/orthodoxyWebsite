            <p>There have been many modern day holy persons with tremendous spiritual gifts. St. Paisios is one of them. Born in 1994, his sweetness has gone through a lot to end up with the spiritual clarity he ofte showed. Many pilgrims would flock to his hermitage throughout his stay at Mt. Athos. Part of what makes St. Paisios so memorable is that he was a miracle-worker. There have been countless miracles performed throughout his life, and even after his death he is still performing miracles. The faithful report seeing him in dreams, some see him manifest physically bearing warnings, some experience healing while praying at his grave. </p>

            <p>Today, there are many thorns in the roads. It is hard to stay on the path. Worse, these people don't say they aren't on the path because they don't know they aren't. This is the root of spiritual deception. They don't know but believe they do.</p>
